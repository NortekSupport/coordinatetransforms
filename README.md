Scripts for coordinate transforms on data from Nortek instruments.

## Transform.m ##
The original transformation Matlab script containing the required steps for transforming data from a 3-beam midlife Nortek instrument from BEAM to XYZ or ENU coordinates, and between all coordinate systems. Requires work from the user to tailor the script to their own instrument/data.

## Sig4beam_transform.m ##
Comprehensive Matlab script for transforming 4-beam Signature data from BEAM to XYZ or ENU coordinates, and between all coordinate systems. Requires little editing.
